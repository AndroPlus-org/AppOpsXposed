AppOpsXposed
============

Module for the [Xposed Framework](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401) that restores the
"AppOps" functionality on Android 4.4.2. 

AppOps can be started from the  native Settings app, under the "Personal" section or, as a fallback, at the 
bottom (usually below the "About" section).
