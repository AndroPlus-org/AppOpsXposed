AppOpsXposed
============

Module for the [Xposed Framework](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401) that restores the
"AppOps" functionality on Android 4.4.2. Note that you still need an app to launch app ops ([this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.findsdk.apppermission)
for example).

APKs can be found under the ["Releases"](https://github.com/jclehner/AppOpsXposed/releases).
